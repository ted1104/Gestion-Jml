				      The platform ““Byose Market” is one of the properties of Darryl General Businesses & Services (Darryl GB&S) Ltd, a privately-held and diversified company essentially evolving in real estate and property selling and management, automotive dealing, digital listing and advertisement as well as e-commerce business and related services in Rwanda.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      The platform ““Byose Market” is a digital advert platform, mainly specialized in real property, vehicle advertising and selling as well as jobs, tender and auction announcements services.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      The ease flow of information about goods and services in the Rwandan market has been a source of headaches for a long time in general, but it is getting even worse in the real estate sector, the used automobile sector and opportunity offers.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      The advert platform “Byose Market” was created to fill the current gap of misinformation and malicious habit of street brokers, to finally produce appropriate and timely information about properties and vehicles for sale or purchase and other opportunities.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      This platform allows individuals, companies or institutions wishing to put on the market their assets or properties, vehicles, advertisements of work, tenders and auctions, to list them better in the sight of all and in the eyes of the whole world.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				        A particular touch is put on the sale of houses, properties and vehicles where owners and buyers in a serious need of concluding a purchase deal will directly make contact for discussing the price and without the intermediary of brokers whose reputation is uncertain (in most of the cases, brokers are in the deal for the sake of their own benefit: they charge for property visit, and request down payment on brokerage fees which cannot be refunded if they fail to execute the contract.
				    </p>
				  </div>

						<p>
				     In addition, brokers inflate sales prices deliberately to collect and receive exorbitant commission fees on each side of the acquirer or the seller once the purchase has been successful).
				    </p>
				    <p>
				      This is not beneficial for the seller since your asset will wait a long time to be sold nor for the buyer because you will not easily find an asset that is suitable for you and relative to the exact value.
				    </p>

				      You were questioning yourself: what is the name Darryl General Business and Services stand for?
